Little Python game based on Thinker.

You have to guess the code which is composed of four different colours taken from a total of eight colours.

You have 11 guesses and your code master will tell you if you have guess colour and position correct (black) or only colour (white) for each guess

Instructions:

 * You can select postion with left and right arrows.

 * You can select colour with up and down arrows

Good luck hacking the code,
